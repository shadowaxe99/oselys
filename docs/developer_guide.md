# Elysium OS Developer Guide

Welcome to the Elysium OS Developer Guide. This document is intended for developers who are contributing to the Elysium OS project. It contains guidelines, best practices, and information on the system architecture and components.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development machine:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Ethereum Wallet (for blockchain interactions)

## System Architecture Overview

Elysium OS is built using a microservices architecture, with the frontend and backend services communicating over GraphQL. The system is divided into several key components:

- **Frontend**: Implemented with React.js and Redux for state management.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js serve as the API layer with MongoDB for data persistence and Redis for caching.
- **AI and NLP**: Integration with OpenAI's GPT-4 for natural language processing.
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum smart contracts for handling NFT and IP rights management.
- **Cloud and DevOps**: AWS and Azure for hosting, Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.

## Repository Structure

The codebase is organized into multiple directories:

- `frontend/`: Contains all the UI components and state management logic.
- `backend/`: Houses the server, API routes, controllers, services, and models.
- `devops/`: Includes Docker and Kubernetes configuration files, as well as CI/CD pipeline definitions.
- `docs/`: Documentation for the project, including this developer guide.
- `tests/`: Test suites for unit, integration, UAT, and load testing.

## Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository and switch to the development branch.
2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend using `npm install`.
3. Start the backend server with `npm run start` in the `backend/` directory.
4. Launch the frontend development server with `npm run start` in the `frontend/` directory.
5. Make changes to the codebase and write tests for new features.
6. Ensure all tests pass by running `npm test` in the respective directories.
7. Commit your changes with a clear message describing the feature or fix.
8. Push to the remote repository and create a pull request against the main branch.
9. Code reviews and CI checks must pass before merging.

## Coding Standards

- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write modular, reusable code.
- Document functions with JSDoc comments.
- Ensure code is well-tested with a high level of coverage.

## Security Practices

- Use environment variables for sensitive information.
- Implement proper error handling and logging.
- Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
- Follow the OWASP security guidelines.

## API Development

- Define new API routes in `backend/src/api/routes.js`.
- Implement controllers in `backend/src/api/controllers.js`.
- Use `backend/src/services/` to encapsulate business logic.
- Follow RESTful principles for API design.

## GraphQL Integration

- Add new queries and mutations to `frontend/src/graphql/`.
- Use Apollo Client for state management in React components.
- Ensure efficient data fetching and state updates.

## Blockchain Development

- Smart contracts are located in `backend/src/integrations/blockchainService.js`.
- Test smart contracts thoroughly before deployment.
- Follow best practices for secure smart contract development.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

- CI/CD is managed through `devops/ci-pipeline.yaml`.
- Dockerfiles are located in `devops/docker/`.
- Kubernetes configurations are in `devops/kubernetes/`.

## Documentation

- Update `docs/developer_guide.md` when introducing new features or changes.
- Use `docs/api_documentation.md` to document API endpoints.
- Provide user manuals in `docs/user_manual.md`.

## Testing

- Write unit tests in the `tests/unit/` directory.
- Integration tests are located in `tests/integration/`.
- User acceptance tests are in `tests/uat/`.
- Load tests can be found in `tests/load/`.

## Conclusion

Thank you for contributing to Elysium OS. Your expertise in UI/UX, especially targeting Gen Z, is invaluable to the success of this project. Together, we will create an AI-integrated platform that redefines user interaction and engagement in the digital age.
